- âœ… Oct. 19, 2023. Add the illustration of psf calculation and the script of analysis module in ray tracing.

## First let me introduce you the how to calculate the psf of a given optical systems

### State the lens and start the analysis
```python
import torch
import difftrace as dg
# load the lens
device = torch.device('cpu')
dtype = torch.float64
lens = dg.System('lens_file/doubleGauss.json', torch.float64, torch.device('cpu'))
# define analysis
views = torch.tensor([0., 10., 14.], dtype=dtype, device=device)
wavelengths = torch.tensor([dg.lambda_F, dg.lambda_d, dg.lambda_C], dtype=dtype, device=device)
ana = dg.Analysis(lens, views, wavelengths, dtype=dtype, device=device)
```
### Calculate the psfs
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
pupil_sampling = 201
image_sampling = 101
image_delta = 0.0005
sample_distribution = 'hexapolar'
psf_kirchoff = ana.psf_kirchoff(pupil_sampling=pupil_sampling, 
                                image_sampling=image_sampling,
                                image_delta=image_delta)
plt.imshow(psf_kirchoff, cmap='jet')
```

*here we optimize the precalculation of the entrace pupil and the rays sampling, so be free to directly use this method*

### We also provide many other analysis such as `spot diagram`, `mtf`, `wavefront map`, ... Please check the ./PSF_generation/ray_tracing/analysis.ipynb for more information
